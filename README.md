# Magista as Partner
## WBS Data Science Bootcamp first project

## Overview
The project took in consideration data sources from Magista, to be evaluated as fulfillment partner in Brazil, as well as context information, such as demographic data from the whole country and development of E-Commerce market. The Magista Data source was evaluated through SQL Queries and presented in Tableu - Powerpoint.

## Objective
To decide wether or not Magista is a suitable partner for the expansion of ENIAC as company in the Brazilian market. 

## Data Source

The data was sourced from [Magista]. Including market, deliveries, review and product aspects, a complete analysis was performed.

## Tools Used

- MySQL Workbench
- Tableau

## Folder Structure

- `/src`: Contains all SQL scripts and code.
- `/data`: Exported data from MySQL Workbench to create Tableau plots.
- `/docs`: Project documentation, reports and presentation.
- `/images`: Images and diagrams used in documentation.

## Analysis Summary

After considering all the variables, the recomendation is not to move forward with the partnership with Magista as fulfillment service for ENIAC. The final conclusions can be separated in three main points.

1. **Low percentage Tech portfolio**: Evaluating all the total amount of products, sellers, revenue and orders it was clear that the percentage of their workload related to Tech is not enough to cover ENIAC's needs. Magista's Tech sector is divided in 15K sellers, and even considering the monthly revenue of all of them together, it would only represent less than 15% of the current ENIAC's revenue. This could also lead to the imposibility of growth in case it would be needed after 3 years of contract.

2. **Low price Tech products**: With a difference of almost 400â‚¬ on the average price of tech products comparing it on the average price of ENIAC's products, operative difficulties could lead to mayor disposal of damaged products, for different reasons like packaging matearial and storage standards.

3. **Deliveries**: Comparing deliveries in the most populated area of Brazil (SP) with the direct competiton in this case the official store of Apple, the delivery times are not competitive. Comparing the rest of the areas less populated of Brazil, the difference has a bigger magnitude.

For these reasons, we do not recommend to partner with Magista. It is important to highlight that the oportunities of the Brazilian market are clear, and finding another partner to enter it would be the most recommended option.
